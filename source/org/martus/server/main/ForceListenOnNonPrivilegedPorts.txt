If this file exists, the server will listen on non-privileged ports 
(9000 + the original port number). This allows developers running 
under Linux to run a server without being root.

To be useful, you must also use ssh to establish tunnels that 
redirect client requests coming in on the normal ports up to the 
ports where the server is listening. These tunnels must be set up 
as root, but they can persist until you reboot.
